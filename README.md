# No-Man-s-Tri
Inspired by No Man's Sky, the goal is to copy systems in the game to see if it's any more fun as a text based game

## Things To Implement (In This Order)
A working planet generator
A weapon generator
A working market system with fluctuating prices
A progression system (I.E moving from planet to planet)
A primitive story line

## Working
Currently generates planet names
## Not Working
Almost everything else
