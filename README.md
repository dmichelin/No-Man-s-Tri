# No-Man-s-Tri
Inspired by No Man's Sky, the goal is to copy systems in the game to see if it's any more fun as a text based game

## Things To Implement (In This Order)
1. A working planet generator
2. A weapon generator
3. A working market system with fluctuating prices
4. A progression system (I.E moving from planet to planet)
5. A primitive story line

## Working
Planet generator currently generates planet names and conditions. A market system is in place with minable resources and generates a basic local market. Player inventory and equipping works. Crafting works and will be player available shortly

## What's going to be on the next update?
I'll have it so the player remembers blueprints and can select them from their inventory or a secondary blueprint inventory. Aliens will also be included, as well as the first "mission" that No Man's Sky gives
