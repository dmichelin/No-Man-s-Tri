# No-Man-s-Tri
Inspired by No Man's Sky, the goal is to copy systems in the game to see if it's any more fun as a text based game

## Things To Implement (In This Order)
1. A working planet generator
2. A weapon generator
3. A working market system with fluctuating prices
4. A progression system (I.E moving from planet to planet)
5. A primitive story line

## Working
Planet generator currently generates planet names and conditions. A market system is in place with minable resources and generates a basic local market. Player inventory and equipping works.
## Not Working

Almost everything else
