# No-Man-s-Tri
Inspired by No Man's Sky, the goal is to copy systems in the game to see what it is like as a text based game. It's in an early alpha stage so features are limited

## Things To Implement (In This Order)
1. A working planet generator // Mostly done, I'll write most of the planet descriptions once the meat of the game is done
2. A multitool generator // Multitool capabilities should be in the next update
3. A working market system with fluctuating prices // Markets are in place and generate randomly, but do not have fluxuating prices. Buying and selling is not implemented yet
4. A progression system (I.E moving from planet to planet) // Player needs warp cells to move from planet to planet
5. A primitive story line

## Working
Planet generator currently generates planet names and conditions. A market system is in place with minable resources and generates a basic local market. Player inventory and equipping works. A crafting system is implemented with permanent blueprints.

## What's going to be on the next update?
Alien communication, life support system, and multitool charging for mining. Randomized mineral type and quantities for mining
